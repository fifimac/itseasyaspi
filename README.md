#Itseasyaspi

Itseasyaspi is a web application, which aids hobby seamstresses in making a custom skirt based on their measurements.

The sites main features are:

1. Secure user log in and registration features, alongside admin functionality.
2. A pattern generator where a user enters their requirements and measurements. Which can be saved and viewed at another time.
3. An interactive instructional manual, where users can view and upload images of their progress of the sewing project.

This application is suitable for sewing enthusiasts of any level, however is designed specifically with a novice in mind.

The sewing methods used to construct this pattern are very basic, however the maths involved in drafting a circle skirt pattern and related errors that may occur, often put people off.

The goal of the website is to provide a platform where a user can engage in a tailored design learning experience where they can stop and start their hobby at their own pace.

The intended experience of using the site should be similar to learning a new skill by trans generational adoption, in that it is personal and self paced.

However the user will not be limited by their physical social limits, as they can engage with other users on the site.
